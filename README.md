(Ignore the blocks in the video, I still havent figured out how to use my fonts in asciinema)

## Purpose
*Pretty Keybaord centric Terminal Music Player in Go using the popular Charm TUI, with Vim Keybindings*

Most Terminal Music Player today is either not pretty, or have the most unintuitive key bindings. This one is meant to be pretty, without being much resource intensive. Written in Go, it can search for all audio files in your Music Folder, and then Play the songs on `enter`. Check out the project, and click the question mark `?` to get more help. I love `cmus`, but it isn't pretty, so now we get `teamus`.

## Build Instructions
For now, you have to have the golang binary installed. For that, check out, check out ["How to Build and Install Go Programs"](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-build-and-install-go-programs). After that just clone this repository, and type `go run .`. Or maybe you can build the repository using `go build`. Also you can test this repo by using the command `go run github.com/aretrosen/teamus@latest`.

**NOTE:** This was made in a Linux environment, with a Music directory. There are plans to add directories via json/yaml file later, but for now you **need** to have the `$HOME/Music` directory. 

## Configuration
You can specify a list of song directories by creating a JSON file at `$HOME/.config/teamus.json` or `$HOME/.teamus.json`.
File example:
```json
{
  "directories": [
    "/home/user/Music",
    "/home/user/My_Musics"
  ]
}
```

## TODOs

- [ ] Seamless playing, with shuffle
- [ ] Repeat Music / Playlist
- [X] Choose files from multiple directories, specified in json.
- [ ] Load from database, refresh only on keypress.

### Additional Features
- [ ] show lyrics on keypress.
- [ ] mouse support. Currently not implemented as I don't use mouse much. If anybody does though, let me know. Also, I am happy to take contributions!!!
- [ ] play `m4a` audio. Currently, even not all `opus` files run correctly. I might have to write many of the audio framewors from scratch.

## Collaboration
You're welcome to write features and report issues for this project.
